# Overview_of_Paper

This repository explores data from "fatal and on-Fatal opioid overdoses in the shelter systems" from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal. I wanted to visualize the trends of opioid-related overdose incidents using data rom 2018 to 2021, and focus on non-fatal overdose reports from specific shelter locations. After this exploratory analysis, I found that more data needs to be collected beyond the confines of the shelter system and needs to be more accurate in collecting data that is suspected for non-fatal incidents.
